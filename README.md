# Pandas-foundations-and-detailed-exploration
Pandas DataFrames are the most widely used in-memory representation of complex data collections within Python. Whether in finance, scientific fields, or data science, a familiarity with Pandas is essential. This course covers real-world data sets containing both string and numeric data, often structured around time series. This course covers powerful analysis, selection, and visualization techniques.  Data ingestion &amp; inspection - We will use pandas to import and inspect a variety of datasets, ranging from population data obtained from the World Bank to monthly stock data obtained via Yahoo Finance. we will also practice building DataFrames from scratch and become familiar with the intrinsic data visualization capabilities of pandas.  Exploratory data analysis - Exploratory data analysis (EDA), is a crucial component of any data science project. Pandas has powerful methods that help with statistical and visual EDA. In this chapter, you will learn how and when to apply these techniques.  This course covers various case studies of different domains
